# Registered Tables

Zepha stores registered structures (blocks, entities, etc.) In tables. These tables can be accessed at runtime to read the properties of a structure, such as a block's groups or toughnesses.

All of the Registered tables are listed below:

## zepha.registered_blocks

Contains all of the [Block Definitions](/docs/definitions/block_definition) for the currently registered blocks.

## zepha.registered_entities

Contains all of the [Entity Definitions](/docs/definitions/entity_definition) for the currently registered entities.

## zepha.registered_blockmodels

Contains all of the [Blockmodel Definitions](/docs/definitions/blockmodel_definition) for the currently registered blockmodels.

## zepha.registered_biomes

Contains all of the [Biome Definitions](/docs/definitions/biome_definition) for the currently registered biomes.
